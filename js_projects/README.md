# [Original Portfolio Site](https://github.com/bbtk421/javascript-projects/tree/master/js_projects/html_css_js_final)

This site was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5 and Javascipt. It was largely influenced by a template provided by the class but heavily customized. I was able to familiarize myself with Bootstrap5 along with simple Javascript animations and effects for the page. It has a few too many doodads for my liking but I wont be making pages for myself so whatever you want you get.

Making this helped me solidify some Javascript fundamentals, event handling and creating a basic UI.
