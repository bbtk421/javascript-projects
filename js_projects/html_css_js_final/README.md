# Original Portfolio Site

This site was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5 and Javascipt. It was largely influenced by a template provided by the class but heavily customized. I was able to familiarize myself with Bootstrap5 along with simple Javascript animations and effects for the page. It has a few too many doodads for my liking but I wont be making pages for myself so whatever you want you get.
